This is a modern, responsive Lost & Found System web page designed for college campuses. Students can easily report lost items or found items through intuitive forms that capture details like item name, category, location, and description. The system features an intelligent auto-matching algorithm that compares lost and found reports based on category similarity, text matching, and location proximity, then displays potential matches with confidence scores. When matches are found above a certain threshold, both parties' contact information is made available so they can coordinate the item's return. The interface uses a contemporary glassmorphism design with smooth animations and works seamlessly across all devices, making it simple for students to reconnect with their belongings.
